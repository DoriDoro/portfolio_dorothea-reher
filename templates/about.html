                  <h3>Long story short(ish)</h3>
                  <p>I formed my essential characteristics in my childhood. Although you can always learn new skills and also change behaviors, my basic characteristics have remained the same, because I like the person I am. I like myself, I work on myself every day and on loving myself. My mother told me about my toddler years. What I remember most and what triggers in me the feeling: "Yes! That's typical Doro!" is when I didn't like the appearance of my closet in my nursery, I completely cleared it out and then completely put it back again, everything neat and tidy. Tidiness was very important to me even when I was a toddler. Since I grew up in my mother's hairdressing business, I grew up with different responsibilities and with independence. My family and I had to rely on each other to keep the day running smoothly.</p>

                  <p>Dogs have always fascinated me. At a young age, I became more intensively involved with dogs. I devoured the subject and I know a lot about the psychology of dogs. The why, how, what a dog does or doesn't do. My power of observation, my patience and my curiosity has made me grow and master the subject of dogs. In the meantime I get along with every dog. Dogs have had a very big influence on my life so far. Already as a toddler I was fascinated by dogs, always wanted to be with them and most of all wanted to be a dog myself. Through dogs I have learned so many things, understood and thereby improved my life. They have accompanied me and dedicated their lives to me. What could be more beautiful?</p>

                  <p>When I go back to my previous working life and look at myself from the outside, I see a hard-working, ambitious and conscientious colleague. I would have liked to work with me because I could be relied on, including being able to say when I couldn't do something, or couldn't do it anymore, or even needed help. The cases filled out were conscientious and very detailed, which I would have especially appreciated. People could always come to me with questions, no matter what the issue, I was always willing to help and willing to share my knowledge. When I sit in front of the computer, I fall into a kind of rigidity. There is the computer and me. We become one and then we have a connection. These "blinkers" are just great, I love to merge with the computer. Short blink breaks to relax my eyes and look out the window to briefly reorder the brain are part of the process. During the breaks, I enjoyed talking with my colleagues, learning more about them, and also learning something new. I love to communicate and learn new things about "God and the world". I prefer to surround myself with calm people who share my good mood, who like to smile and are sensitive and with whom I can have serious and deep conversations. </p>

                  <p>I like to let out my concentrated energy while walking with dogs, whether on a bike, jogging together or walking for hours. Now with my son we go for walks together with the stroller and have fun. Even when it rains we jump through the puddles with rubber boots and enjoy the day. Before my son came into the world, I was incredibly fond of dancing. Merging with his dance partner to the music while dancing and making two bodies into one is the absolute best feeling in the world. </p>
